# Cuatro Elementos Espacio Sonoro
Cuatro Elementos Espacio Sonoro | Project made with HOA Lib

This is a PD Extended project that runs with the HOA Lib (http://hoalibrary.mshparisnord.fr). Follow the instructions on the website to install the library in PD Extended.

The idea of this project is to represent in a Binaural space the four elements of nature (air, water, wind and earth). You start the project by executing 'main.pd' file and activate each element one by one. The binaural library will take care of each element.
